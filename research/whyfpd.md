> Functional program -> Fundamental operation is applying functions to arguments
- no side effect and immutability
- FP enhances composeability. different ways to glue a program together (makes me think of function composition and higher order funcs)
- defines partial function application using foldr as an example
- Functional programming, by its nature, enables a clean way to abstract common patterns through functions, glued together through higher order functions.
- Holy shit. So much can be built from the standard cons operator (`:` in Haskell). By using `:` and function composition one can do some DAMAGE.
> Whenever a new datatype is defined, higher-order functions should be written for processing it.
- lazy evaluation enables a different kind of abstraction to exist. filtering from generating
